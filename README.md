# Introduction

Hello! I am Daksh, an M.S. (Research) student studying mathematics at IISER Trivandrum, India. My interests are primarily algebraic number theory, representation theory and related areas. I am learning to use GitHub. This repository contains a draft of my ongoing Master's thesis (On the General Theory of Valuations and Class Field Theory), a reading project report on Finite Groups I did in 2024, my CV, as well as some academic articles I authored in my undergraduate days. Please feel free to reach out at dakshadheer23@iisertvm.ac.in.
