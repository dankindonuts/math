# Introduction

Hello! I am Daksh, an M.S. (Research) student studying mathematics at IISER Trivandrum, India. My interests are primarily algebraic number theory, representation theory and related areas. I am learning to use GitHub. This repository contains a draft of my ongoing Master's thesis, a reading project report on Finite Groups I did in 2024, as well as some academic articles I authored in my undergraduate days.
